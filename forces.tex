\section{Principia}
\textit{Philosophi\ae \ Naturalis Principia Mathematica}, Latin for "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", is often referred to simply as the Principia.  The work consists of three books by Sir Isaac Newton, in Latin, first published in 1687.  The Principia states Newton's laws of motion, forming the foundation of classical mechanics, also Newton's law of universal gravitation, and a mathematical derivation of Kepler's empirically derived laws of planetary motion. The Principia is justly regarded as one of the most important works in the history of science.

\section{Newton's First Law}


\textit{Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed.} \textbf{\textit{- Principia}}


$$\sum \overrightarrow{F}=0\ \ \longrightarrow \ \ \overrightarrow{a}=0$$

\newthought{In an inertial frame}, an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion unless an external net force acts upon it.  Newton's first law is often called the Law of Inertia.

 \marginnote[50pt]{
\textit{Inherent force of matter is the power of resisting by which every body, so far as it is able, perseveres in its state either of resting or of moving uniformly straight forward.}\\   \noindent\textbf{\textit{- Principia}}}
\subsection{Inertia}
\newthought{Inertia is the resistance} of any physical object to any change in its state of motion including changes to its speed and direction or the state of rest. It is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at constant velocity. The principle of inertia is one of the fundamental principles of classical physics that are used to describe the motion of objects and how they are affected by applied forces. Inertia comes from the Latin word, iners, meaning idle, sluggish. Inertia is one of the primary manifestations of mass.  Matter is the occupancy of mass over space therefore matter has inertia.

\subsection{  Space and Time Uniformity}
\begin{description}
  \item [Homogeneity] A homogeneous system has the same properties at every point; it is uniform without irregularities.  The laws of physics must be invariant (unchanging) to translations in space.  The location of the coordinate system does not change physics.
  \item [Isotropy]  A isotropic system has the same properties in all directions.  The laws of physics must be invariant to rotations in space.  The orientation of the coordinate system does not change physics.  
  \item [Time-Independence] A time-independent system has the same properties throughout time.  The laws of physics must be invariant to translations in time.  The start time of the physicist's watch does not change physics.
 \end{description}








\section{Newton's Second Law}
\marginnote[0pt]{
\textit{A change in motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force is impressed.}  \\   \noindent\textbf{\textit{- Principia}}
}

Newton's second law states the sum of forces on an object is equal to the product of mass and acceleration of the object.
$$F_{net}=ma$$

Stated another way, the sum of forces is equal to the time rate of change of momentum.

$$\sum \overrightarrow{F}=\lim_{\Delta \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{p}}{\Delta t}=\lim_{\Delta \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta (m\overrightarrow{v})}{\Delta t}=m\lim_{\Delta \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{v}}{\Delta t}=m\overrightarrow{a}$$

\newthought{Momentum is defined} as the product of mass and velocity. Though Newton does not use the term he describes a \textit{quantitas motus}, "quantity of motion", as "arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly", which identifies it as momentum.  Thus, in the second law, when he refers to \textit{mutatio motus} being proportional to the force impressed, he is generally taken to mean momentum again.  It remained only to assign a standard term to the quantity of motion. The first use of "momentum" in its proper mathematical sense is not known but Jenning's 1721 \textit{Miscellanea} defines momentum, or "quantity of motion", as "a rectangle", the product of Q and V, where Q is "quantity of material" and V is "velocity".  

\marginnote[-80pt]{
\textit{The quantity of matter is that which arises conjointly from its density and magnitude. A body twice as dense in double the space is quadruple in quantity. This quantity I designate by the name of body or of mass.}
\\   \noindent\textbf{\textit{- Principia}}
}
$$\underbrace{\overrightarrow{p}}_{\textit{momentum}}=\overbrace{m}^{\textit{inertial mass}}\underbrace{\overrightarrow{v}}_{\textit{velocity}}$$

\begin{marginfigure}[40pt]%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{snore.jpg}
  \caption{If you wakeup from sleeping on a train moving at constant velocity, there is nothing about the physics in the train that tells you it's moving.  The constant velocity train is inertial and a legit frame of reference from which to do physics.}
  \label{fig:marginfig}
\end{marginfigure}
\newthought{Galilean invariance} or Galilean relativity states that the laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames. Galileo Galilei first described this principle in 1632 in his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems using the example of a ship travelling at constant velocity, without rocking, on a smooth sea; any observer doing experiments below the deck would not be able to tell whether the ship was moving or stationary.  Newton's second law is invariant to change in the velocity of the frame.


\section{Newton's Third Law}
\newthought{The third law states} that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction: if object one exerts a force $\overrightarrow{F}_{ 1\rightarrow 2}$ on object two , then object two simultaneously exerts a force $\overrightarrow{F}_{ 2\rightarrow 1}$ on object one, and the two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
$$\overrightarrow{F}_{ 1\rightarrow 2}=-\overrightarrow{F}_{2\rightarrow 1}$$

The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies,and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body. This law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law, with $\overrightarrow{F}_{ 1\rightarrow 2}$ called the "action" and $\overrightarrow{F}_{ 2\rightarrow 1}$ the "reaction". The action and the reaction are simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the action and which is called reaction; both forces are part of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.

\marginnote[-130pt]{\textit{To any action there is always an opposite and equal reaction; in other words, the actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and always opposite in direction. }\\   \noindent\textbf{\textit{- Principia}}
}

\newthought{The contemporary mantra} for Newton's third law is uttered as follows.\\ \ \\ \textbf{Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.}

\section{Forces}
Forces are vector quantities as they had magnitudes and direction in space.  Summation of forces follows vector addition.   The unit of force is the Newton, or N.  This is one kilogram meter per square second.  

\marginnote[-40pt]{The English pound is a unit of force equivalent to $4.45$ Newtons.
$$1\ \text{lbs}=4.45\ \text{N}$$}

$$1\ \text{Newton}=\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$$



\subsection{Statics}
\newthought{Statics is the branch of mechanics} that is concerned with the analysis of force loads on physical systems in static equilibrium, that is, in an inertial state where the relative positions of subsystems do not vary over time.  When in static equilibrium, the system is not being accelerated.  Therefore, by Newton's first law, the vector sum of the forces is zero.

\begin{marginfigure}[-50pt]%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pulley.jpg}
  \caption{This could be a static or dynamic system, depending on the balance of forces.}
  \label{fig:marginfig}
\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{Dynamics} 
\newthought{Dynamics is the branch of mechanics} concerned with the study of forces and and their effect on motion.  In a dynamic situation the net force is non-zero and there is a resultant acceleration.  Newton's second law is invoked when analyzing a dynamic system. 



\section{Free Body Diagrams}
\newthought{A free body diagram is a graphical illustration} used to visualize and conceive of the applied forces on a body.  In the current treatment we represent particles with a dot and draw all forces incident on the particle as a vector diagram with all force vectors with their tail at the point.  

\marginnote[-70pt]{Once a coordinate system is established all forces can be decomposed in terms of components and summed across the component directions.  The resultant force determines the acceleration.  In some cases first knowing the acceleration gives an understanding of the constituent forces. }

\section{Weight}
\marginnote[30pt]{Modern work on gravitational theory began with the work of Galileo Galilei in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In his famous (though possibly apocrypha) experiment dropping balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later with careful measurements of balls rolling down inclines, Galileo showed that gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate. This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects accelerate faster. Galileo postulated air resistance as the reason that lighter objects may fall more slowly in an atmosphere. Galileo's work set the stage for the formulation of Newton's theory of gravity.}
\newthought{Gravity is a natural phenomenon} by which all things with mass are brought towards (or 'gravitate' towards) one another including stars, planets, galaxies and even light and sub-atomic particles. Gravity is responsible for the complexity in the universe, by creating spheres of hydrogen, igniting them under pressure to form stars and grouping them into galaxies. Without gravity, the universe would be an uncomplicated one, existing without thermal energy and composed only of equally spaced particles. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the tides. Gravity has an infinite range, and it cannot be absorbed, transformed, or shielded against.

\marginnote[60pt]{\textbf{Weight is the gravity force on a body.}}

Up until now mass has only been considered in its inertial properties.  Gravity is another feature of mass.  At the surface of the Earth, massive objects accelerate at a rate of $g=9.81\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$.  Therefore by Newton's second law it follows that, at the surface of the Earth, the force due to gravity, otherwise known as the \textbf{weight}, is equal to $mg$.
