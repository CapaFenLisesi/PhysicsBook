\marginnote{As no contemporary portrait of Robert Hooke seems to have survived from the seventeenth century, this one is a reconstruction from the descriptions by his colleagues Aubrey and Waller. It shows him with a spring, pocket watch, fossil and map of the City of London after the Great Fire of 1666. He helped to survey and plan the rebuilding. The sky on the left indicates his interest in astronomy.}


\section{Simple Harmonic Motion}
\subsection{Hooke's Law}

Hooke's law represents a linear restoring force to a point of equilibrium.  This is a model for the ideal spring.  The constant of proportionality, $k$, between the force and displacement is called the spring constant.  For other linear systems $k$ is used to represent the constant of proportionality and simply referred to as the $k$ constant.
$$F_{spring}=-kx$$
This physical system behaves according to a differential kinematic relationship.  Specifically the acceleration has a negative proportionality to the position.
$$F_{spring}=F_{net}=ma$$
$$m \lim_{\Delta \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=-kx$$
$$\lim_{\Delta \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta (\Delta x / \Delta t)}{\Delta t}=-\frac{k}{m}x$$
$$a=-\frac{k}{m}x$$

\subsection{Energy}
\begin{fullwidth}
The classical harmonic oscillator is a lovely system in terms of symmetry.  Kinetic and potential anergy have equal influence over the evolution of the system.  The inertial quantity $m$ weights the squared velocity to constitute the kinetic energy whereas the elastic quantity $k$ weights the squared distance to constitute the potential energy.

$$KE=\frac{mv^2}{2}\hspace{2cm}PE=\frac{kx^2}{2}$$
$$E=KE+PE$$
$$E=E_0=\frac{mv_0^2}{2}+\frac{kx_0^2}{2}=KE_{max}=PE_{max} \hspace{2cm} KE=E_0-PE=E_0 (\sin^2(2\omega t+\phi) ) $$
$$|v_{max}|=\sqrt{\frac{2E_0}{m}} \hspace{2cm} |x_{max}|=\sqrt{\frac{2E_0}{k}}$$


\section{Pendulum}

\footnotesize{

A pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely.  When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position. When released, the restoring force combined with the pendulum's mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth. The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period. The period depends on the length of the pendulum, and also to a slight degree on the amplitude, the width of the pendulum's swing.}

Newton's second law for rotation of rigid bodies written below.  The net torque is equal to the product of the moment of inertia and the angular acceleration. }
$$\tau_{net}=I\alpha$$
\footnotesize{Substituting the torque and moment of inertia yields the following equation.}
$$mgl\sin{\theta}=ml^2\alpha$$
\footnotesize{The underlying differential relationship of the system is that the double time rate of change of the angle is the ratio of the restoring torque and the inertial moment.}
$$\lim_{\Delta \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta^2 \theta}{(\Delta t)^2}=-\frac{g}{l}\sin\theta$$

\footnotesize{
From its examination in around 1602 by Galileo Galilei, the regular motion of pendulums was used for timekeeping, and was the world's most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930s.  Pendulums are used to regulate pendulum clocks, and are used in scientific instruments such as accelerometers and seismometers. Historically they were used as gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity in geophysical surveys, and even as a standard of length. The word "pendulum" is new Latin, from the Latin pendulus, meaning 'hanging'.  The simple gravity pendulum is an idealized mathematical model of a pendulum.  This is a weight (or bob) on the end of a massless cord suspended from a pivot, without friction. When given an initial push, it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude. Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag, so the amplitude of their swings declines.

\subsection{Small Angle Approximation}
$$\sin \theta=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n\theta^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}=\theta-\frac{\theta^3}{3!}+\frac{\theta^5}{5!}-\cdots$$
$$\lim_{\theta \rightarrow 0} \sin \theta \approx \theta$$

$$\lim_{\Delta \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta (\Delta \theta / \Delta t)}{\Delta t}\approx-\frac{g}{l}\theta$$

$$\Omega(t)=-\omega A\sin(\omega t)+\omega B\cos(\omega t)$$

\section{Magnitude and Phase}
$$A\cos(t)+B\sin(t)=R\cos(t+\phi)$$

\section{Damped Harmonic Oscillator}
\normalsize
The differential equation that represents the simple harmonic oscillator system is written below.
$$ma=-fx \hspace{2cm} ma+kx=0$$
This equations gives the following solution.
$$x(t)=A\cos(\omega t)+B\sin(\omega t) $$
The dampening occurs when a force is introduced that is proportional to the velocity.  This is the dampening force.
$$ma=-\beta v-kx$$
